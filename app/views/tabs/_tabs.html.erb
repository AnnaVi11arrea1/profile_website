      <p class="card-text">I started my small art and vending business in 2017. Since then, i've traveled the country

          <p>These bell bottoms feature a design that was originally a painting I created. I digitized it and added some modifcations
            to create the pattern using photoshop and illustrator. Using a mock-up interface online, I can see a preview image of 
            how my design will look on clothing. I can tell you they are much nicer in person!</p>

          <%= image_tag "blacklight.jpg", class:"gallery-image" %>
          <p>I create my own pieces of art using primarily blacklight reactive acrylic paint and paint markers. I love the glow of the
            fluorescent paint when it's dark and the energy it gives off. It's quite stunning to see in person. These really make the
            vendor booth look fanastic at night creating quite a spectacle for onlookers. If you're lucky, maybe you can catch me 
            painting at festival one of these times!</p>
