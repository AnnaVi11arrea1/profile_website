      <h2>My small business: Ever Fluorescent</h2>
      <p class="card-text">I started my small art and vending business in 2017. Since then, i've traveled the country 
        selling my products at events both large and small. You can usually find me at a festival live painting and managing my booth.</p>

      <div class="mycard">  
        <%= image_tag "bell_bottoms.jpg", class:"gallery-image" %>
        <p>These bell bottoms feature a design that was originally a painting I created. I digitized it and added some modifcations
          to create the pattern using photoshop and illustrator. Using a mock-up interface online, I can see a preview image of 
          how my design will look on clothing. I can tell you they are much nicer in person!</p>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="mycard">
        <%= image_tag "blacklight.jpg", class:"gallery-image" %>
        <p>I create my own pieces of art using primarily blacklight reactive acrylic paint and paint markers. I love the glow of the
          fluorescent paint when it's dark and the energy it gives off. It's quite stunning to see in person. These really make the
          vendor booth look fanastic at night creating quite a spectacle for onlookers. If you're lucky, maybe you can catch me 
          painting at festival one of these times!</p>

      <div class="mycard">
        <%= image_tag "mens_tank.png", class:"gallery-image" %>
        <p>These tanks are a new addition to my product line. I've been working on creating a line of clothing that is more 
          affordable and accessible to a wider audience. I'm excited to see how they do at my next event. I'm always looking for 
          feedback on my products so if you see me at an event, please stop by and say hello!</p>
        </p>

      <div class="mycard">
        <%= image_tag "outfit.jpg", class:"gallery-image" %>
        <p>I recently finished a painting featuring an elephant holding the weight of the world and created my first full on 
          outfit from that design with matching hoodie and flared pants. This vibe is awesonme for a festival.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="mycard">
        <%= image_tag "painter.jpg", class:"gallery-image" %>
        <p>I was born an artist. I've been painting for over a decade now. I love creating art and using it to make people feel
          more alive. I'm always discovering new ideas and techniques. If you're interested in painting, please don't hesitate
          to reach out!</p>
